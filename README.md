# The Impact of Human Behavior in Emergency Evacuations

This repository contains the project developed in the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems course.
The idea of this project was to model different aspects of individual human characteristics and behaviors in situations of emergency evacuations (for example, when there is a fire), and try to better understand their impact through computer simulations. Some aspects that we have considered were cooperation (is it "better" to communicate to others that there is a fire happening even though I may get prejudiced by it?), the layout of the building (give two layouts, for example, for a supermarket, is one of them better than the other regarding the rate of survivors?), and many others as can be seen in the ```settings.py``` file.

To run the project, simply run ```$python main.py``` inside the root directory.
Make sure you have python and pygame installed.

Note: The file demo.py is not part of the main project. It is an auxiliary file that was used to run the simulations for experimental results for the report.
